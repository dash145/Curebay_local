                Healthcare is a huge challenge in India. We have a large population spread over large and diverse geography. There is a considerable shortage of healthcare providers (1 doctor per 12000 people in public healthcare against a WHO recommended ratio of 1 doctor per 1,000 and for nurses it is 1:600 against 1:300 recommended). Even more worrying is the fact that with 75% of doctors in urban areas, 74% of multi-speciality hospitals in top 8 metros and 60% of available beds in private hospitals in top cities , availability of healthcare is skewed towards urban population â€“ just 28% of Indian population. This leaves the remaining 72% of Indian semi-urban and rural population with very few reliable sources of healthcare.
